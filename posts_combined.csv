170,"Ali Reza Nipu I really love watching football and also I’ve started off making income with out financial risk from acquiring bonus deals. It’s this weird technique where you wager on something with one bookmakers and bet against it on Betfair. You secure the bonus as income . A chap named Jim Vanstone is finding the wagers free on his own website Vanstone Secrets (Google it!). I’ve made about 500 quid thus far. And it is cost-free. I guess the bookies pay him to obtain new consumers, yet this actually works."

That works like that in EUW ( Germany/ Netherland/ France/ Portugal/ Belgium/ Spain/ ... ) Just because the Britishs don&#39;t agree to be like us because they are UNIQUE. That&#39;s the reason why they also refused to have euro (€) as money
